      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>Welcome to my site! Designed to practice my html, css, and javascript skills, filled with examples of what can be done with these programming tools, and a helpful "notebook" for myself, to keep track of my studies. </p>
      <p>Let's try changing something.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">creating a github page</a></p>
      <p>Try this - go to repository settings, go to pages, click "main" under the part that talks about Branches <a href="https://echristensenbyui.github.io/WhatIveLearned/">link</a></p>
      <h3>Ideas for sections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML
          <ul>Shortcuts, such as basic code for navigation, subnavigation, etc</ul>
        </li>
          
        <li>Github
          <ul>how to start a new repository, how to push the changes, how to go between github and computer in vs code (File > open folder links to folders, if you are not in a github repo than you just click the icon with the desktop/circle and it should show you links to repository, it just might take a little practice. Keep practicing.</ul>
        </li>
